title: Using Machine Learning to find pretty pictures
---

Maching learning provides many oppourtunities for us to leverage the computational power of a computer without having to expressly define the exact flow of a logic throughout. For this reason i'm going to try use machine learning plus instagrams API's to separate a list of photos into ones that are probably good and the others.
